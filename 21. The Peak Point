The Peak Point
Description

Given an array of size n, which is strictly increasing and then strictly decreasing in order. Find out the index (0-based) which is the peak of the array.

Note that the extremities are not considered as peak and there exists a peak which is not at index 0 or at n-1.


Input
The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100000).

The second line of the test case contains n integers (1 ≤ Ai ≤ 100000) and they are all distinct in nature.


Output
For each test case, print the answer: The peak index.
