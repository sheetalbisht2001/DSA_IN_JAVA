Masai reward system
Description

There is a new policy for the reward system for a contest here at Masai.

Whenever a person solves a problem, that person gets a coin.

The first person to solve a problem gets an additional coin.

A contest has 26 problems, labelled A, B, C, ..., Z. You are given the order of solved problems in the contest, denoted as a string s, where the i-th character indicates that the problem si has been solved by some person. No person will solve the same problem twice.

Determine the total number of balloons that everyone received (combined).

Note that some problems may be solved by none of the people.


Input
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer t — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n — the length of the string.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of length n consisting of uppercase English letters, denoting the order of solved problems.

Constraints
1 ≤ t ≤ 100

1 ≤ n ≤ 50


Output
Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer — the total number of balloons that everyone received.

Hint

First testcase
In the first test case, 5 balloons are given out:

Problem A is solved. That person receives 2 balloons: one because they solved the problem, an an additional one because they are the first one to solve problem A.

Problem B is solved. That person receives 2 balloons: one because they solved the problem, an an additional one because they are the first one to solve problem B.

Problem A is solved. That person receives only 1 balloon, because they solved the problem. Note that they don't get an additional balloon because they are not the first one to solve problem A.

The total number of balloons given out is 2+2+1=5.

Second testcase
In the second test case, there is only one problem solved. The team who solved it receives 2 balloons: one because they solved the problem, an an additional one because they are the first one to solve problem A.
