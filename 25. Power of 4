Power of 4
Description

You are given a number stored in a variable with the name,nums

You have to find the value of the number raised to the power of 4

For example, if the value stored innum = 3. Therefore, the value of 3 raised to the power of 4, equals3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81, which is the required answer

Therefore, the output is81


Input
The first and the only line of the input contains the value stored innum


Output
You have to print the value of the number, stored innum, raised to the power of 4


Sample Input 1

3
Sample Output 1

81
Hint

In the sample test case, the value stored innum = 3. Therefore, the value of 3 raised to the power of 4, means3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81, which is the required answer
